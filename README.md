## Used techniques
This site is build with the Nuxt.js framework. It uses the Google Maps and Google Maps Places API. 

### Browser
At this moment, the website works best on a desktop browser. The site is not mobile-friendly at this point. This would be a great next step to develop.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
